            <h3>Valak | Unity 3D, Solidity, Figma, C Sharp, Remix IDE</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Visualized in a hackathon, integrated crypto wallet into game behavior.</li>
                <li>Conceptualized and created the game as team Valak, introducing a novel NFT acquisition approach.</li>
                <li>Based on horror theme, made player acquisition of hidden tokens challenging by navigating obstacles.</li>
